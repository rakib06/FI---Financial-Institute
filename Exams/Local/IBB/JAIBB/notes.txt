### Question Setting Pattern

IBB‘s examination is basically a professional programme. Therefore, the question setting
pattern of a professional degree cannot be a traditional, bookish and straight-forward one. The nature
of question papers of all courses of IBB must be applied, conceptual, practice-oriented,
problem-solving and case-study based. The questions should be thought provoking and analytical in
nature. The ultimate objective of the professional examination is to enhance the conceptual,
analytical and operational skill of the financial market practitioners. Intellectual ability, creativity
and conceptual depthness of financial market practitioners would be possible to be developed
through formulating question scripts having above mentioned features. This transformation in
question paper setting should not be brought instantly. It should be done gradually and
uninterruptedly. Initially, the proportionate share of narrative traditional questions might be fifty
percent and the rest fifty percent might be case-based, problem solving and other practice oriented
nature. Gradually, based on experiences, we can move towards fully practice oriented professional
question paper.
